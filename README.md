# Bloody Silence
This is a shooter unlike any you have ever played. There is no sound whatsoever,
so you will need to use your eyesight to find indicators of enemy presence. The
silence will deafen you. The silence will kill you. Unless you kill the enemy 
first.

Come play if you're ready for a challenge. Or, join us [on Discord][Discord]
